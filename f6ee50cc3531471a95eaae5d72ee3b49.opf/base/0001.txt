Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas.
Thus have I heard at one time.
The Blessed One was dwelling in Rājagṛha at Vulture Peak Mountain together with a saṅgha of , monks and five thousand eminently famous bodhisattva mahāsattvas who had attained the superknowledges,
the retentions,
the miraculous power of magical display,
and acceptance that phenomena are unborn
—famous ones such as the bodhisattva mahāsattva Siṃha,
the bodhisattva mahāsattva Siṃhamati,
the bodhisattva mahāsattva Fine Sandalwood,
the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sārathi,
the bodhisattva mahāsattva Mahāsārathi,
the bodhisattva mahāsattva Prabhāśrī,
the bodhisattva mahāsattva Radiant,
the bodhisattva mahāsattva Endowed with Brilliant Light and Having a Melodious Voice,
the bodhisattva mahāsattva Prabhāvyūha,
the bodhisattva mahāsattva Clear Mind,
the bodhisattva mahāsattva Essence of Beings,
the bodhisattva mahāsattva Disciplined Charioteer of Beings,
all the bodhisattva mahāsattvas of the Fortunate Eon,
such as Maitreya,
and other bodhisattvas such as Mañjuśrīkumārabhūta and so forth.
